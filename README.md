# civstats-mod
Civilization 5 mod that keeps track of various information on player's games and 
works in conjunction with civstats-app to upload this information a website.

## Compatibility
Only tested with AllDLC and NQMod+AllDLC.

## Installation
Put the Civstats folder in your game's `Assets/DLC` directory.

## TODO
- [x] add `distance` and `captured` information for natural wonders (`distance` would be how many tiles from capital)
- [ ] add `culture`, `tourism`, and `faith` to demographics
- [ ] consider adding more information on the game (pitboss/network multiplayer/hotseat multiplayer etc)
- [ ] consider spy steals tracker? spies killed / successful tech steals (which techs)
- [ ] able to track whether wonders were engineered/hardbuilt?
